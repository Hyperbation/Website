## [Hyperbation Mixed Reality Viewer](HyperbationViewer)
This iOS webXR browser is a customization forked from Firefox's Project [WebXR Viewer](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/webxr-ios) for exhibition visitors to view virtual art works streamed from local server.

## [AA Zoo School](AAZooSchool)
AA Zoo School was a web-based mixed reality architectural extravaganza based on WebAR technology [A-frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe). Designed by Pete Jiadong Qiang and Mingxuan Xie, and following in a long tradition of wildly extravagant performance at the AA, Hyperbation collides archival material with a cast of virtual characters. It supposed to be a ongoing development that welcome everyone to contribute. You can find all the required files in AA Zoo School folder.
